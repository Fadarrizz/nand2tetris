# Unit 1.5: Hardware Simulation

## Hardware simulation in a nutshell

To test a HDL file, we can load it into a hardware simulator. This kind of simualion is called
*interactive simulation*.

With a test script, we can think ahead of how we can systematically test a chip. We load the HDL file
along with test script into a hardware simulation. This mode is called *script-based simulation*.

A final option is to store the output file(s) and compare these to a desired output.
