# Unit 1.3: Logic Gates

Gate Logic is a technique for implementing Boolean functions using Logic gates.

Logic Gates are small, elementary chips that deliver a specific functionality 
(NAND, AND, OR, NOT, etc).

A Composite Logic Gate is made up of more than one functionality and is therefore more complex.

An Gate Interface is the abstraction of the implementation. It answers the question 'what'.
There is only one interface to describe the functionality of a gate. But there can be many 
implementations. One is more efficient or more elegant than the other.
