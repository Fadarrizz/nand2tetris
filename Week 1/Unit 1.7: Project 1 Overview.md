# Unit 1.7: Project 1 Overview

## Multiplexor

```
if (sel==o)
  out=a
 else
  out=b
```

**Truth Table**
a | b | sel | out
--- | --- | --- | ---
0 | 0 | 0 | **0**
0 | 1 | 0 | **0**
1 | 0 | 0 | **1**
1 | 1 | 0 | **1**
0 | 0 | 1 | **0**
0 | 1 | 1 | **1**
1 | 0 | 1 | **0**
1 | 1 | 1 | **1**

**Abbreviated truth table**
sel | out
--- | ---
0 | a
1 | b


### Example: using mux logic to build a programmable gate**
```
if (sel==0)
  out = (a AND b)
 else
  out = (a OR b)
```

**Mux.hdl**
```HDL
CHIP AndMuxOr {
  IN a, b, sel;
  OUT out;
  
  PARTS:
  And (a=a, b=b, out=andOut);
  Or  (a=a, b=b, out=orOut);
  Mux (a=andOut, b=orOut, sel=sel, out=out);
}
```
## Demultiplexor

- Acts like the inverse of a multiplexor
- Distributes the single input value into one of two possible destinations

## Example: Multiplexing / demultiplexing in communications networks

- Each `sel` bit is connected to an oscillator that produces a repetitive train of alternating 0 and 1 signals
- Enables transmitting multiple messages on a single, shared communications line
- A common use of multiplexing/demultiplexing logic

## Best practice advice
- Try to implement the chips in the given order
- If you don;t implement some chips, you can still use them as chip-parts in other chips (use built-in implementations)
- You can invent new, helper chips; however, this is not required, you can build any chip using previously-built chips only
- Strive to use as few chip-parts as possible.
